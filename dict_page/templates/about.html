<h1>About this app</h1>
<p>This is an English dictionary application scripted in Python.
It takes a word as input from user. This word is then searched in a data file stored locally on sqlite database.
It then returns one or more meanings for the word.
This program will incorporate a glimpse of artificial intelligence and if the user misspells the word by a little margin
then it will suggest the correct word.
